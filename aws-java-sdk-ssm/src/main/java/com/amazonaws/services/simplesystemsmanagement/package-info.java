/**
 * <p>
 * Amazon Web Services Systems Manager is a collection of capabilities that helps you automate management tasks such as
 * collecting system inventory, applying operating system (OS) patches, automating the creation of Amazon Machine Images
 * (AMIs), and configuring operating systems (OSs) and applications at scale. Systems Manager lets you remotely and
 * securely manage the configuration of your managed nodes. A <i>managed node</i> is any Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud
 * (Amazon EC2) instance, edge device, or on-premises server or virtual machine (VM) that has been configured for
 * Systems Manager.
 * </p>
 * <note>
 * <p>
 * With support for IoT Greengrass Version 2 devices, the phrase <i>managed instance</i> has been changed to <i>managed
 * node</i> in most of the Systems Manager documentation. The Systems Manager console, API calls, error messages, and
 * SSM documents still use the term instance.
